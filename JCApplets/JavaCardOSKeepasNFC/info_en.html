<p>Install the applet - no installation parameters required. Once installed, you can use an android app to upload your keepass credentials onto card. The link to the app along with detailed tutorial 
can be found in the web links section below</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the tutorial, you can skip almost the whole &quot;pyApduTool&quot; section as the store do this for you automatically. 
Only thing you have to do yourself is to send custom APDU command to the applet once installed - go to your card and select the KeepasNFC applet. Click 
&#39;send custom command&#39; and pass command <strong>B075000000</strong> to tell it to generate new keypair. Now, the applet has generated the keypair (assuming the card master key is default 4041..4F, e.g. we didn&#39;t have to provide it when using gp).</p>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> This applet is not considered to be ultimately secure (for common usage will suffice though): <a href="http://javacardos.com/javacardforum/viewtopic.php?t=998#p3043">http://javacardos.com/javacardforum/viewtopic.php?t=998#p3043</a>.</p>
