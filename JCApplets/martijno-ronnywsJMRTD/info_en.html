<p>Download the host application and install it. If you have 64bit java and the installer thinks you don&#39;t have java, you need to download 32bit java version.</p>
<p>Install the applet onto card. No parameters are required. If the installation fails due to technology support issues, we recommedn to install the no-EAC applet instead.</p>
<p>Use the host application to manage passports, and eventually upload them onto card (open passport in edit mode, select Tools -&gt; Upload Passport).</p>
<p>The uploaded passport should be readable from any ePassport compatible reader.      </p>
