More details on this in HOTP/TOTP section. The 'save action' will require you to use a card as the actual credentials are to be transfered onto applet. After that, the applet is initialized with the entries you provided and ready to perform HOTP or TOTP based on your account settings.</p><h3>HOTP/TOTP</h3><p>is a one-time-password generator protocol that relies on counter (HOTP) or a timestamp (TOTP). Counter is increased every time new password is generated, the timestamp includes a time limit the password is valid within (30/60s).<br> The one-time passwords are good for 2FA (two factor) authentication. More information on how to proceed can be found on the websites that support 2FA in the links below (linkedIn, for example: </u>https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/531</u>). For the host app account creation, you have to have your account existing - and add the two factor authentication feature to it by adding your account to android app that initializes the applet.

	"description": "<p>Open source javacard applet implementing a Bitcoin hardware wallet with full BIP32 support. SatoChip stands for Secure Anonymous Trustless and Open Chip. It is a javacard applet that can be used as a secure hardware wallet running for example on a Yubikey Neo. The SatoChip has full BIP32 supports. <br> Using SatoChip, an initial BIP32 seed is imported in the javacard and private keys are derived as requested by an external application. Private keys are never exported outside of the secure chip. To improve performances, the result of key derivation is cached in secure memory for future requests so that a specific derivation path is only computed once.<br>The Satochip also supports the import of regular (non-BIP32 keys) such as vanity keys. Here again, private keys cannot be exported outside of the secure chip. Up to 16 regular keys can be imported on the chip. In any case, the private keys can be used to sign transactions and Bitcoin messages, if sufficient credentials are provided.<br>Access to private keys (creation, derivation and signature) is enforced through the use of PIN code.<br>The Satochip wallet is currently in Beta, use with caution! In this phase, it is strongly recommended to use the software on the Bitcoin testnet only. This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.</p>",

Change the values only if you know you have to.<h3>KeyCard applet (A000000804000101)</h3><p>There can be multiple instances of this applet installed. Append to the applet AID the number of an instance you install. Valid nubers are 0x00 - 0xff (255), For first installation add 0x01 as 'first instance':<b>A000000804000101<u>01</u></b>.</p><h3>NDEF applet (A000000804000102)</h3><p>This applet AID has to conform to it's own package. However, the actual installation has to be done with different AID as NDEF applets are supposed to have certain AID for communication. The correct AID for NDEF applet is <b><u>D2760000850101</u></b>.</p><h2>Keycard Applet usage</h2><p> After the installation, download the latest release of host application from its repository in the links below. The app can communicate with the applet; it can also install it - but this can be done in this store as well (it will install all the applets and won't let you choose unlike JCAppStore). Nevertheless, the app is still needed for further applet initialization and usage.</p><h3>Initialize applet</h3><p>in command line, either navigate to the folder where you've downloaded the host app executable, or make sure it is in a folder contained in your PATH environment variable (windows - unlikely in a PATH, either add it manually or go to the installation folder, unix - likely in /usr/bin) and run following command: <b>keycard init -l debug</b>. More info can be found in the app repo readme file.</p><h3>Harware wallet host app</h3><p>Once initialized, download any app that supports hardware wallets - smart cards. WallETH is an android ethereum wallet that supports a smart card pairing - simply select 'NFC smart card' once app starts, then 'add initialized wallet' as we initialized the walled just before. Then, provide PIN and pairing code you've received from keycard client app and tap the card to your phone.</p><h2>NDEF tag usage</h2><h>NDEF tokens are compatible with any android device equipped with NFC. Just download any NDEF tag application from Google Play to use. Apple phones should work similarly.</p>",
