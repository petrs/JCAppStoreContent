<p>The installation should be simple. There are two applets available: KeyCard and NDEF tag. KeyCard can be used as a key holder or bitcoin wallet. 
KeyCard can be used with Status app, WallETH or Gnosis. NDEF tag is compatible with any NDEF writer/reader application (for example on Google Play).</p>

<h4 id="status-app"><a class="header-link" href="#status-app"></a>Status app</h4>
<p>Status is secure messenger, browser and ethernum bitcoin wallet. The KeyCard can be inicialized upon generating the keys - download Status app and generate new keys. 
Then, store them on your card (instead of on your phone) with KeyCard installed. This will cause the application to require the card for authentication and more importantly - 
your keys are safer.</p>
<h4 id="walleth"><a class="header-link" href="#walleth"></a>WallETH</h4>
<p>WallETH is ethernum bitcoin wallet, much less intuitive than Status app. It is necessary personalise the applet first (using CLI app or Status app).</p>
<p><strong>CLI personalise</strong>: download the latest release of host application from its repository in the links below. </p>
<p>The app can communicate with the applet; it can also install it (but it will install all the applets and won&#39;t let you choose unlike JCAppStore). 
Nevertheless, the app is still needed for further applet initialization.</p>
<p>Using CLI initializer: in command line, either navigate to the folder where you&#39;ve downloaded the host app executable, or make sure it is in a folder contained in your PATH environment variable (windows - unlikely in a <code>PATH</code>, 
either add it manually or go to the installation folder, unix - likely in <code>/usr/bin</code>) and run following command: <code>keycard init -l debug</code>. More info can be found in the app repo readme file.</p>
<p>Once initialized, download any app that supports hardware wallets - smart cards. WallETH is an android ethereum wallet that supports a smart card pairing - simply select 
&#39;NFC smart card&#39; for new account creation once app starts, then &#39;add initialized wallet&#39; as we initialized the walled just before. Then, provide PIN and pairing code you&#39;ve received from keycard 
client app and tap the card to your phone.</p>
<h3 id="ndef-tag-usage"><a class="header-link" href="#ndef-tag-usage"></a>NDEF tag usage</h3>
<p>NDEF tokens are compatible with any android device equipped with NFC. 
Just download any NDEF tag application from Google Play to use. Apple phones should work similarly.</p>
