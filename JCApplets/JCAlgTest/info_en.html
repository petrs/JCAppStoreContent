<p>The installation should be simple without any required information. Install this applet on the card you want to test. You can install default (newest version and latest sdk). If the install fails, choose different, older sdk version as the card might not support it.</p>
<p>This applet is also usable directly from JCAppStore - you don&#39;t have to install anything, just go to the menu: App &gt; Card and run the smart card test.</p>
