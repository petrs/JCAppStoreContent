<p>No installation parameters are required. Once installed, install and run Electrum-satochip host app from the link below.
Create new standard wallet and select hardware wallet. You will be asked to setup your PIN for the applet. Continue with the dialog window, if the app does not respond wait a while - 
it talks to the smart card. Once done, you can start using your personal bitcoin wallet! </p>
<p><strong>Use with care: the bitcoins are not accessible if you accidentaly erase the applet or destroy/lose your card!</strong></p>
<p>The Electrum-Satochip wallet is currently in Beta, so use with caution! In this phase, it is recommended to use the software on the Bitcoin testnet only (<code>electrum.exe -v --testnet</code>). </p>
